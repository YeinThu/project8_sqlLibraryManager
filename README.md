# Project 8 - SQL Library Manager

## Project Details
* This web application uses an intuitive way to maintain 
  and manage data within a database. A library and it's collection of books will be used to demonstrate this.
* First, the app initially loads a collection, or a list 
  of books from the library. The user is able to access 
  different functionalities in the app, such as viewing the list of books, adding a new book to the library, 
  and updating or deleting a book from the library.
* The app uses a combination of JavaScript, Node.js, 
  Express, Pug, SQLite as the database, and the SQL ORM 
  Sequelize.
